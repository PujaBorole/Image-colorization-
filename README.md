# Image Colorization 
Image colorization using Autoencoder and GAN.

# About Project
One of the most exciting applications of deep learning is colorizing black and white images. This task needed a lot of human input and hardcoding several years ago but now the whole process can be done end-to-end with the power of AI and deep learning. Our project is concerned with implementing a generative adversarial network that takes black and white images as input and the output obtained is a corresponding colored image. We also used Autoencoder model and developed front end UI for it.
